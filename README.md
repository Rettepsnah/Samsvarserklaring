Ground Handling Declaration Form (Samsvarserklæring)
Purpose This is a web-based tool designed to digitize the Ground Handling Declaration process required by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/20. It replaces traditional paper forms, allowing organizations to declare compliance and operational details for ground handling services at EU aerodromes efficiently.

Key Functionality

Smart Airport Lookup: Users simply enter a 4-letter ICAO code (e.g., ENGM), and the form automatically fetches and fills in the Airport Name and State, reducing data entry errors.

Digital Signature: Features an integrated signature pad, allowing the Accountable Manager to sign the document directly on the screen using a mouse or touch device.

Compliance & Service Checklists: Interactive checkboxes cover all required regulatory areas (Safety Management, Training, etc.) and specific services provided (Annex).

Print-to-PDF Optimized: The form is styled to look like a professional official document when printed. It automatically hides web elements (like "Clear Signature" buttons or instruction text) to generate a clean PDF for submission to authorities.
